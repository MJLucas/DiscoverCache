<h1> DiscoverCache </h1>

<h3> My first ever iOS app made using Swift 2 & Xcode 7. This app was made whilst in my second year at university. </h3>

<h4> The Project Scope </h4>

DiscoverCache is an iOS app, which allows users to retrieve and view geocached media. The geocache includes a piece of data that is personal to the creator: in this case a snapshot of them at that specific location. The app requires users to be in close physical proximity to each geocache (and wonâ€™t allow users to view content otherwise e.g. without being in the location). Once a user moves into proximity of a geo-located cache an alert is triggered causing the phone to vibrate intermittently. The user is them prompted to give them the option to view the geocache data or ignore it. Should the user choose the ignore the geocache, the notification will simply disappear and for it to reappear, they will need to leave that specific zone and re-enter. 

If the user chooses to view the geocache, they will be prompted to open their camera (which they can accept or decline - declining will prevent access to the geocache) and take a random picture. Once the users takes a picture, the content of the geocache will be displayed on their phone. 

When the user decides that they no longer want to view the geocache, they can either return back to the map where they will no longer see the message (unless they leave that specific zone and re-enter) or they can close the application fully and carry on with what they were doing.

<h4> Future Plans for the Project </h4>

Looking back on this application, there are multiple things that I would like to do to further the potential of the application overall. There might be a time in the future where I do return to this project and revamp it, however this being my first official iOS project after only learning how to use Xcode and Swift at the start of my second year of university, I am happy with the outcome.
